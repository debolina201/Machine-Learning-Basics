# Machine-Learning-Basics

Here, we study and analyze 4 major classification techniques that are widely used, namely, 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machines, and
4. Multi-layer perceptron

We have applied these classification techniques to different datasets and measured their accuracy of prediction for the respective datasets. A deeper insight into the accuracy of the results helps us to determine which classification technique shall be suitable for a particular type of dataset.
